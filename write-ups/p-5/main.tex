   \subsection{Algorithm Selection}
   The first thing that was done to complete this project was to select the algorithm we wanted to research. To do this, we started by researching the different types of algorithms that existed, limiting ourselves to algorithms to those of which were invented after 1980. After some research, we narrowed the choices down to two or three different algorithms. After some further deliberation, we decided to use the Burrows-Wheeler transform for this project. We chose the Burrows-Wheeler transform because we found the algorithm to be both interesting and applicable to many relevant topics in computer science.
