# CSCI-432-Project
Advanced Algorithms 432: Final Project

## Part 1: 

One-page summary about an algorithm that we find particularly interesting followed by an explanation and why we find it interesting.

Due: 11th of October 2019
COMPLETED.

## Part 2: 

Investigate three different algorithms. For each algorithm, you must identify the problem being solved. Do not go into the details of the algorithms itself, unless they solve the same problem.

* Deliverable: 2-3 page write up submitted as a PDF.
* Due Date: 30th of October 2019
### Individual contribution status:

George: 100% COMPLETED
- Chose bi-directional breadth first search.
Troy: 0%
Gavin: 0%
Tommy: 0%

## Part 3: 

Selection of algorithm: You must select the algorithm that you will be investigating. This does not need to be one of the algorithms discussed in P-2, but is likely to be one of those. 

* Deliverable: Up to two page write up identifying the problem being solved and pseudo code for the algorithm it's self.
The deliverable is an (up to) two-page write-up identifying the problem being solved and providing pseudo-code for the algorithm itself. Not all steps need to be fully explained, but the general essence of the algorithm should be clear. 10 points.
* Due Date: 11th of November 2019

### Project part status:

- Need to select Algorithm, preferably one that we have a clear idea of our +1 for: NOT COMPLETED
- Write up problem statement: 0%
- Write up explanation of Algorithm: 0%
- Write up Pseudo code for Algorithm: 0%
- Provide time complexity (probably to be included in the explanation, no need to necessarily 'prove' it: NOT COMPLETED

## Part 4: 

* Deliverable: Up to three page write up
* Due Date: 18th of November

### Project part status: 

Identify the +1 element of your project. Essentially mproving the algorithm in some way, be it speed, clarity, additional feature. explain the analysis of the algorithm in a different way than provided in the paper, provide a runtime analysis if there is none, compare it against two or three other algorithms, walk through an example or two, explain the algorithm more clearly/concisely than the original publication, thoroughly explaining one of their proofs, etc. You are free to be as creative as you want for your +1 element, but I highly suggest you discuss this with the instructor or TA before this deadline. 
 
- Identify +1 element of the Algorithm (Improvement): NOT COMPLETED
- Write up for identifying/defining the problem: 0%
- Provide Pseudo code for the algorithm with the +1 element: 0%
- Identify/Explaining our +1 Element: 0%
- Provide run time analysis of pseudo code with the +1 Element and compare it to the origional algorithm's run time analysis: 0%

## Part 5: 

Demonstration of process: prepare a document outlining (A) what you have done so far and (b) what is left to be done.

* Deliverable: One to two page write up (Submitted as a PDF)
* Due Date: 25th of November 2019

### Project part status:

- Keep track of progress for the +1 element of our algorithm: 0%
- Write up report for progress for algorithm: 0%

## Part 6: 

Video Presentations. Each group will present their video in class.

* Deliverable: Personal Reflection
* Due Date: Last week of class 2019

### Project part status:

- Introduce video
- Answer questions about the video from fellow sudents
- Independant one page contributions summary detailing personal contributions as well as the strengths/weaknesses of the project. Include one thing that you would do differently if you could do it again.

## Part 7: 

Final Exam Time. Peer evaluation occurs in which we discuss the peer evaluations that where filled out during video presentations.

* Deliverable: Group report to be written and submitted in class
* Due Date: Finals week 2019


## EC: 

Up to five points extra credit for using version controll of LaTex documents & other non-video project files.
